    "# Lesson 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Quiz 10 introduced you to Python’s `datetime` module and two of its types:\n",
    "the `date` type and the `timedelta` type.\n",
    "This lesson lets you practice those skills a bit more!\n",
    "You will need four things for this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to know how to loop over a series of dates.\n",
    "Here are two approaches that we discussed on Wednesday.\n",
    "In both cases they loop over all of the days in the upcoming Spring Semester.\n",
    "This one uses a familiar `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from datetime import date, timedelta\n",
    "\n",
    "    start = date(2021, 1, 20)\n",
    "    end = date(2021, 5, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "    d = start\n",
    "    days = (end - start).days + 1\n",
    "    for i in range(days):\n",
    "        print(d)\n",
    "        d = d + timedelta(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "And this one takes the simpler but less familiar approach\n",
    "of using a `while` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from datetime import date, timedelta\n",
    "\n",
    "    start = date(2021, 1, 20)\n",
    "    end = date(2021, 5, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "    d = start\n",
    "    while d <= end:\n",
    "        print(d)\n",
    "        d = d + timedelta(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing you need to know is the range of class dates\n",
    "in Bluffton’s current Fall Semester:\n",
    "\n",
    "2020 August 17 — 2020 November 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Third and fourth, you will want to consult Python’s documentation\n",
    "about the date type, and about the date formatting placeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects>\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://strftime.org/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all of that information,\n",
    "this lesson has you tackle three exercises!"
